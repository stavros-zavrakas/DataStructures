Basic data structures in C
-----------------------------

Currently you can find examples of:
- linked list
- sorted linked list
- sorted double linked list
- publish subscribe system

@todo:
  - convert the main functions of the linked list, sorted linked list, sorted double linked list to be the test functions.

  - convert the publish subscribe project to use the linked list, sorted linked list, sorted double linked list libraries and create the makefile.
